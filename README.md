## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── backend
    ├── fronend
    ├── .gitignore
    └── README.md

1.  **`/backend`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to backend”

2.  **`/fronend`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
